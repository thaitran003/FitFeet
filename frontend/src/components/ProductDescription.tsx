          Inspired by the original low-profile tennis shoes, the Nike Killshot 2
          updates the upper with various textured leathers to create a fresh
          look. From soft suedes to smooth leathers with the perfect sheen, it's
          courtside attitude with a modern touch. To prove you're on top, the
          rubber gum sole adds the cherry on bottom.

          Created for the hardwood but taken to the streets, the basketball icon
          returns with classic details and throwback hoops flair. Channeling
          '80s vibes, its padded, low-cut collar lets you take your game
          anywhereâ€”in comfort.
